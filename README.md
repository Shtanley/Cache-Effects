# Cache-Effects
Experiment 1 gives a simple demonstration of Cache effects.  
Experiment 2 compares the time taken to access elements of an array as its size increases which is used to verify size of the CPU cache.  
Experiment 3 compares the traversal times between an array, linked list & unrolled linked list.
